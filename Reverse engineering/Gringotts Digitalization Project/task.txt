Gringotts Digitalization Project

Author: Aleksi

Gringotts bank is still working on their digitalization project, and now they've put up some new servers. The server was quickly hacked, and you've gained access. Unfortunately there's not that much you can do with your access, except mine MagicCoins, but that's a waste of CPU cycles.

You've heard rumors that the IT-wizards put in a backdoor in case they need to recover access to the server, maybe you can find it and grab a flag?
