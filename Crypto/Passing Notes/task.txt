Passing Notes

Author: Einar Antonsen - Chabz/Chabaluz

In one of my classes, some students were sending notes back and forth. I confiscated one of the notes, but it only contained this:

vyLlwWSY1PCK5ELNTPUVdpl8z0rIXiB2+Ybcu/BeXidR3MEiym852HCkS6wHVCr+CdpP6Moe9VQUeFcyq3vZDpVK/orl+8vREYMRrnQR9O4=

I got curious and decided to hack into their server, but the only interesting information I could find was this hash:

bbb2c5e63d2ef893106fdd0d797aa97a

and the following code:

import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
from struct import pack

BS = 16
secret = b'not_the_secret'
key = SHA256.new()
key.update(secret)

def encrypt(key, message):
    iv = Random.new().read(BS)
    pad_len = BS - divmod(len(message), BS)[1]
    padding = [pad_len]*pad_len
    padding = pack('b'*pad_len, *padding)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(message + padding))

But now I'm stuck. Think you can help me out?
