Headmasters: A History

Author: Einar Antonsen - Chabz/Chabaluz

It's time for a small history lesson! In the TG:Hack area there are some portraits of previous headmasters of TG:Hack School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. Your task is to identify all the headmasters. The flag consists of the initials of each headmaster, from left to right. Good luck!
Tips

Remember to use TG19{...} when submitting the flag!
