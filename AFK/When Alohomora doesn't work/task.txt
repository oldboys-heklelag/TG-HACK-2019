When Alohomora doesn't work

Author: maritio_o

Hey, you! Magnificent wizards and witches! Come here.. Have you seen the padlocks at the UiO stand and the TG:Hack area? These padlocks have been tampered with so that no wizardry like the Alohomora spell will work on them. There is no other way than to pick the locks like the muggles do. I bet you are no good without your wand..

If you can pick any of the padlocks, you may ask the muggle students for the flag! No magic trickeries to get the flag though, be nice to the students.

Remember to ask for help if you are stuck. Picking locks like muggles do require a special technique. You may either ask the UiO students, or the TG:Hack crew for help. We ask you kindly not to use force against the padlocks. That will ruin the experience for all your fellow wizards and witches!
