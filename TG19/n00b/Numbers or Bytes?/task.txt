Numbers or Bytes?

Author: Christian Resell - PewZ

Can you convert some numbers and bytes for us? Do it 1000 times, and you shall receive the flag!

nc bytes.tghack.no 2010

NB! Use bytes_to_long and long_to_bytes :) And remember to hexlify the result of long_to_bytes before sending it to the server.
Tip

You are supposed to use pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) as shown in the Python tutorial to solve this task.
