Pwntions 1

Author: Marit Iren - maritio_o

"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the minds, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even put a stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."

â€”Professor maritio_o's introduction of the subject

As you've understood from the introduction to pwntions lectures, we want to teach you the art of stack overflows. Stack overflow is an ancient way of making pwntions, and neither wizards or muggles have gotten affected by this pwntion in many decades.

In the classes we tested our pwntions on a house elf vulnerable to this stack overflow. Can you brew this right, and give it to him? Don't worry, it is not deadly.. He will just grow a large nose, and tell us his deepest secrets..

Here, take this binary file and the source code for local pwning.

nc pwntion1.tghack.no 1061

Tip

    The file expects to read a file called banner.txt. For the binary to work locally, you should make a file with that name and put whatever you would like into it.

    Read the Introduction to Pwntions tutorial to learn about this type of stack overflow problem.
