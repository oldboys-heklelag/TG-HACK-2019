"Remember those lectures about Pwnie? Now is your chance to show what you've learned!"

â€”Professor maritio_o

Our beloved house elf is unfortunate to be vulnerable to the stack overflow pwntions.

This time, we want you to take the given ingredients and brew the pwntion so that his ears turns equally large as the nose?

Take these files for local pwning, the source code and the binary.

nc pwntion2.tghack.no 1062

Tips

    The file expects to read a file called banner.txt. For the binary to work locally, you should make a file with that name and put whatever you would like into it.

    Read the Stack Overflow pt. 2 section in the Introduction to Pwntions tutorial to learn about this type of stack overflow problem.
